This is my robot program. Unfortunately for some reasons (some of which I don't remember anymore) I could not use ROS. So I had to rewrite lots of 
functionallity which is provided by ROS. Anyway there are multiple directories in this project and a brief explanation of each is given below.

apps:
===============
This folder contains applications for testing and actual robot programs. The full robot program is not implemented yet but it should not be hard to add, since 
most of the work is done in common and interfaces directories.

cmake-modules:
==============
This directory contains CMake configuration files which are not available by default. Since they were not provided by default, there is no gaurantee 
that they will work on other systems.

common:
==============
This is the most important directory. All the functionallity that is used and all interfaces are defined here. Interfaces all derive from 
KSRobot::common::Interface class, which declares basic functionality that every interface should support. EngineInterface is the base class that 
acts as a collection and bridge between all interfaces of a robot.

gui:
=============
Some Qt gui classes. used for debugging mostly, and probably for final robot program.

interfaces:
=============
All interfaces which are defined here. The classes are:

KinectDeviceReader: For reading images and generating pointclouds from a kinect device. uses PCL's OpenNIGrabber.
KinectDatasetReader: For reading images and generating pointclouds from a freiburg dataset directory.
ICPInterface: For odometry using ICP Algorithm. not implemented yet.
FovisInterface: Visual odometry using FOVIS algorithm.
iSAM2Interface: iSAM2 slam algorithm. not implemented yet.
MTEngine: Multithreaded engine interface. All code from all interfaces will be run using this class.
OctomapInterface: mapping using Octomap. Also some other functionality such as removing ground plane are implemented.
SerialEngine: This probably will not be implemented ever. May be removed.
            
libksrobot:
==============
This directory implements some python wrapping for tests using boost::python.
        
roboctrl:
==============
Contains control modules for the robot we are using (RobX). We built the robot from scratch, so this code won't work for other robots.
