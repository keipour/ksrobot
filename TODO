(PRIORITY)                 Description
==========================================================================

(HIGH)  Implement code for moving robot while turning
(HIGH)  Test LoopClosure and OctomapInterface
(HIGH)  Import GTMAP
(HIGH)  Fovis (or ICP) How to provide feature match, and not just features.
        This probably means I should write a different class for robot trajectory
        and share it across VO,SLAM, Mapping,etc. This causes updates in one class be easier
        but also introduces additional problems like locking or on slam update.
        Also takes time, probably at least a day.

(HIGH)  common::PlannerInterface: It is probably better if it was not an interface, but just a helper class
        which can be used by other classes. Implementing a motion planner using OMPL and OccupancyGridMap 
        should be easy (relatively).

(HIGH) Implement robot algorithm
