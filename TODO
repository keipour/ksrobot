(PRIORITY)                 Description
==========================================================================

IMPLEMENT:
(HIGH)  Implement code for moving robot while turning
(HIGH)  Import GTMAP
(HIGH)  Fovis (or ICP) How to provide feature match, and not just features.
        This probably means I should write a different class for robot trajectory
        and share it across VO,SLAM, Mapping,etc. This causes updates in one class be easier
        but also introduces additional problems like locking or on slam update.
        Also takes time, probably at least a day.

(HIGH) Implement final robot algorithm

TEST:

(HIGH)  Test LoopClosure and OctomapInterface
(HIGH)  Test motion planner.
